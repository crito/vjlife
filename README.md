The game of life as a VJ tool.

This is work in progress, and not yet ready.

The idea is to render the game of life fullscreen in an canvas element. The
seed pattern is created by taking a snapshot with the webcam and reducing the
bit depth. The goal is to continously run this loop, once all cells die,
or after a certain time, the loop is restarted.

The evolution of the pattern is the actual visual effect, and is to run at
places, where you like to provide visual stimulants, like parties.
